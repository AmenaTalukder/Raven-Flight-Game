Gameplay Mechanics:
<br>Objective: Shoot down ravens to earn points and avoid letting them escape off-screen.
<br>
Scoring: For every raven hit, players earn points that contribute to their overall score. Every 30 points earned increases the game level by 1.
<br>
Leveling System: As players reach new levels (every 30 points), the game becomes increasingly challenging. Each new level brings a 0.5x increase in game speed, making ravens move faster and appear more frequently.
<br>
Visuals and Audio: The game features smooth sprite animations, dynamic background visuals, and sound effects that enhance the immersive experience. Explosions occur when ravens are hit, adding to the excitement.
<br>
Controls: Players use their mouse to aim and click to shoot down ravens. The game also includes pause, run, and quit buttons for easy control during gameplay.
<br>
<br>Challenges:
As the game progresses, players will need quicker reflexes and sharper aim to keep up with the increasing speed of the ravens. The game's difficulty scales with the player's score, ensuring that every session is unique and challenging.
